To build the program, you should first run the "make clean" command, to remove any files 
from old attempts to build the executable. Then, you should run the "make build" command,
to compile all the Java classes and create the "412alloc" executable shell script. Finally,
you can run "./412alloc" followed by the below command-line arguments (an absolute or relative
pathname to the input file, and optionally up to one of several "flag" arguments dictating
the program's behavior) to actually run the program on an input file.

Modes:
    -h: prints the help message (all required command-line arguments as well as
        optional flags)
    -x: scan and parse the input ILOC block; performs renaming on the code in the input block and prints the results to standard out
    k [filename]: k is the number of registers available to the allocator (3 ≤ k ≤ 64) and [filename] is a Linux pathname to the file containing the input ILOC block. The pathname can be either a relative pathname or an absolute pathname. Scans, parses, and allocates the code in the input ILOC block so that it uses only registers r0 to rk-1 and print the resulting code to standard out.
